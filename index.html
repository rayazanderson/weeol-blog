             So far, my experience with git has been interesting to say in the least. I understand the simpler commands for the console in the virtual machine. I'd say the most complicated process was to not just make separate branches,but to merge those branches into the "master branch"-which is basically the root to your main projoect. Without it, your whole project might collapse, so be careful! Despite how difficult git and github can be the first time around, over time it obviously gets easier. 
           </p>
              The only criticism that I have with github is that if you lose track with what you're doing, it can easily ruin your own project, thus having ot start over from either where you left off, or the project entirely.
